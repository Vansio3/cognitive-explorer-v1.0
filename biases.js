    { name: "Fundamental Attribution Error", category: "social", description: "Judge others on character, ourselves on situation.", example: "They're late = lazy. I'm late = bad morning.", id: "fundamental-attribution-error", longDescription: "This is the tendency to overemphasize personality-based explanations for others' behaviors while underemphasizing situational explanations. Conversely, we often attribute our own negative behaviors to situational factors ('I was stressed') and positive ones to our character ('I'm naturally good at this'). It stems from how we process information – we see others' actions but don't always know their context, whereas we are acutely aware of our own internal state and external pressures. Recognizing this helps foster empathy and avoid unfair judgments.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Self-Serving Bias", category: "social", description: "Successes are ours, failures are situational.", example: "Win = hard work. Fail = bad sleep.", id: "self-serving-bias", longDescription: "A common habit of thought where we take credit for positive events or outcomes, attributing them to our internal qualities (like skill or intelligence), but blame negative results on external factors beyond our control (like bad luck or unfair circumstances). This bias helps protect our self-esteem but can hinder learning from mistakes and lead to interpersonal conflicts if we consistently avoid responsibility. It's prevalent across cultures but may manifest differently based on societal values.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Bandwagon Effect", category: "social", description: "Adopt beliefs/fads as more people do.", example: "Everyone's getting fidget spinners, so they must be good.", id: "bandwagon-effect", longDescription: "This effect describes how individuals are often influenced by the perceived popularity of a trend, belief, or behavior. As more people adopt something, others jump on board, sometimes regardless of their own underlying preferences or evidence. This can be seen in fashion, politics ('voting for the likely winner'), investment bubbles ('FOMO' - Fear Of Missing Out), and social media trends. It leverages our desire for social conformity and the heuristic that popularity often indicates value or correctness (though not always).", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Availability Heuristic", category: "belief", description: "Rely on easily recalled examples.", example: "Choose store from most recent ad.", id: "availability-heuristic", longDescription: "This is a mental shortcut where we judge the likelihood or frequency of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Things that are recent, vivid, dramatic, or frequently repeated (like plane crashes in the news vs. car accidents) feel more probable than they statistically are. While often efficient, it can lead to skewed risk perception and poor decision-making based on salient but unrepresentative information.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Confirmation Bias", category: "belief", description: "Seek/remember info confirming existing beliefs.", example: "Ignoring evidence against a conspiracy theory.", id: "confirmation-bias", longDescription: "One of the most pervasive biases, Confirmation Bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. We actively seek out confirming evidence and dismiss or downplay disconfirming evidence. This happens because challenging our beliefs is cognitively demanding and emotionally uncomfortable. It contributes to belief perseverance, polarization, and resistance to changing one's mind.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Anchoring", category: "belief", description: "Rely heavily on the first piece of info.", example: "'50% off? Must be a great deal!'", id: "anchoring", longDescription: "Anchoring bias occurs when we rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the 'anchor') when making decisions. Subsequent judgments are often adjusted around this initial anchor, even if it's irrelevant or arbitrary. This is heavily used in negotiations (starting with a high price), sales ('original price' vs. sale price), and even estimations. Breaking free requires conscious effort to consider information outside the initial anchor.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Sunk Cost Fallacy", category: "money", description: "Invest more due to past costs, ignore future.", example: "'In for a penny, in for a pound!'", id: "sunk-cost-fallacy", longDescription: "Also known as the 'Concorde fallacy,' this occurs when we continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, or effort), even when objective analysis suggests stopping or changing course is the rational choice. We feel that abandoning the effort would mean the prior investment was 'wasted.' Decisions should ideally be based on future prospects, not unrecoverable past costs. This impacts personal finance, business projects, and even relationships.", requiredLevel: 1 },
    { name: "Placebo Effect", category: "learning", description: "Belief in treatment causes physiological effect.", example: "Sugar pill reduces reported pain.", id: "placebo-effect", longDescription: "The Placebo Effect refers to a phenomenon where a fake or inert treatment (like a sugar pill, sham surgery, or saline injection) can produce real, measurable improvements in a patient's condition simply because the patient expects or believes it will work. This demonstrates the powerful connection between the mind and body. It's a crucial factor in clinical trials, where new treatments must prove significantly better than a placebo to be considered effective.", requiredLevel: 1 },

    // --- LEVEL 2 ---
    { name: "Halo Effect", category: "social", description: "One positive/negative trait influences perception of others.", example: "'She's cute, so she must be kind.'", id: "halo-effect", longDescription: "The Halo Effect is a type of cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person (or brand, product, etc.) based on one prominent positive trait (like attractiveness, perceived intelligence, or status) influences our judgments of their other specific traits (like competence, kindness, or honesty). The opposite, the 'Horns Effect,' occurs when one negative trait colors overall perception negatively. It's a mental shortcut that simplifies judgment but can lead to inaccurate assessments in areas like hiring, performance reviews, and even legal settings.", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "False Consensus", category: "social", description: "Overestimate how many people agree with us.", example: "'Everybody thinks that!'", id: "false-consensus", longDescription: "This is the tendency to overestimate the extent to which other people share our own opinions, values, beliefs, and behaviors. We often assume our own perspectives are the 'normal' or default ones. This can happen because we tend to associate with like-minded people (availability heuristic) and because projecting our views onto others can boost self-esteem. It can lead to misunderstandings and surprise when encountering differing viewpoints.", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "Framing Effect", category: "belief", description: "Draw different conclusions from same info based on presentation.", example: "45% approval: 'killing it' vs 'disappointing'.", id: "framing-effect", longDescription: "This cognitive bias shows that our decisions can be influenced by how information is presented or 'framed.' Options framed in terms of potential gains tend to be favored over options framed in terms of potential losses, even if the underlying outcomes are identical (e.g., '90% survival rate' vs. '10% mortality rate'). Positive framing often leads to risk aversion, while negative framing can encourage risk-taking. It's widely used in marketing, politics, and public health messaging.", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "Dunning-Kruger Effect", category: "learning", description: "Less knowledge = more confidence; more knowledge = less confidence.", example: "Amateur confidently gives expert advice.", id: "dunning-kruger-effect", longDescription: "This cognitive bias describes a phenomenon where individuals with low competence in a particular area tend to overestimate their ability, while individuals with high competence tend to underestimate their ability relative to others. The lack of skill prevents the incompetent from recognizing their own mistakes, leading to inflated self-assessment. Conversely, experts assume tasks easy for them are easy for others. It highlights the link between competence and metacognitive awareness (knowing what you don't know).", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "Status Quo Bias", category: "belief", description: "Prefer things stay the same; resist change.", example: "Sticking with invasive app rather than switching.", id: "status-quo-bias", longDescription: "This is an emotional preference for the current state of affairs. We tend to favor keeping things as they are, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a potential loss or risk. This makes us resistant to switching brands, adopting new technologies, or changing established routines, even if objective analysis suggests the alternative is better. Loss aversion and mere exposure effect contribute to this preference for the familiar.", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "Gambler's Fallacy", category: "money", description: "Believe past random events influence future ones.", example: "Losing streak means a win is 'due'.", id: "gamblers-fallacy", longDescription: "This is the mistaken belief that if a particular outcome occurs more frequently than normal during a period of independent random events (like coin flips or roulette spins), it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa). People may think a losing streak makes a win 'due,' or a winning streak must end soon. In reality, each event is independent, and past outcomes do not influence future probabilities in truly random processes.", requiredLevel: 2 },
    { name: "Google Effect (Digital Amnesia)", category: "memory", description: "Forget info easily found online.", example: "Constantly looking up same actor's name.", id: "google-effect", longDescription: "Digital Amnesia refers to the tendency to forget information that we believe can be easily retrieved using search engines or digital devices. Because we know the information is readily accessible externally, our brain may not allocate the resources needed to encode it deeply into long-term memory. We remember *where* to find the information rather than the information itself. This impacts how we learn and retain knowledge in the digital age.", requiredLevel: 2 },

     // --- LEVEL 3 ---
    { name: "In-Group Favoritism", category: "social", description: "Favor people within our group.", example: "Like church members more than outsiders.", id: "in-group-favoritism", longDescription: "Also known as in-group bias, this is the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive as members of their own group ('in-group') compared to those they see as belonging to different groups ('out-groups'). This can be based on nationality, religion, sports team affiliation, or even trivial assignments in experiments. It's thought to have evolutionary roots related to cooperation and resource allocation but can lead to prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination in modern society.", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Spotlight Effect", category: "social", description: "Overestimate attention others pay to us.", example: "Worried everyone notices your 'lame' T-shirt.", id: "spotlight-effect", longDescription: "We tend to feel that our actions, appearance, and even our mistakes are intensely noticed by others, as if a spotlight follows us. In reality, people are usually much more preoccupied with their own thoughts and lives. This bias stems from our egocentric perspective – our own experience is vivid and central to us, so we assume it is for others too. Understanding this can help reduce social anxiety and self-consciousness.", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Just-World Hypothesis", category: "belief", description: "Believe world is just; misfortunes are deserved.", example: "'Bad karma caused the theft.'", id: "just-world-hypothesis", longDescription: "This is the cognitive bias (and assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person; thus, it is the assumption that noble actions are eventually rewarded and evil actions eventually punished. Believing the world is just helps us feel that we have control over our lives and that the world is predictable. However, it can lead to rationalizing injustice and blaming victims for their suffering ('They must have done something to deserve it').", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Survivorship Bias", category: "learning", description: "Focus on successes, ignore failures.", example: "Copying one successful company, ignoring ten failures.", id: "survivorship-bias", longDescription: "This is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process ('survivors') and overlooking those that did not, typically because they are less visible. This can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored. Examples include studying only successful companies to learn business strategy (ignoring failed ones), or admiring old buildings for their longevity (ignoring ones that collapsed). It requires actively seeking out information on the 'non-survivors' for a balanced view.", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Backfire Effect", category: "belief", description: "Counter-evidence strengthens existing beliefs.", example: "'Proof against my theory is fake!'", id: "backfire-effect", longDescription: "Related to Confirmation Bias, the Backfire Effect describes how corrections or counter-evidence presented against a deeply held belief can sometimes cause the individual to strengthen that belief instead of questioning it. This may happen because the challenge feels like a personal attack, triggering defensive mechanisms, or because the counter-argument forces the person to generate more reasons supporting their original stance. It makes correcting misinformation particularly difficult.", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Stereotyping", category: "social", description: "Assume group characteristics apply to individuals.", example: "'Hipster with mustache must love vinyl.'", id: "stereotyping", longDescription: "Stereotyping is a cognitive shortcut where we categorize people into groups and assume that individuals within a group possess certain characteristics believed to be typical of that group. While categorization helps simplify a complex social world, stereotypes are often overgeneralized, inaccurate, and resistant to change. They can lead to prejudice (negative attitudes) and discrimination (negative behaviors) when applied rigidly to individuals, ignoring their unique qualities.", requiredLevel: 3 },
    { name: "Zeigarnik Effect", category: "memory", description: "Remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones.", example: "Feeling guilty about undone tasks until seeing completed list.", id: "zeigarnik-effect", longDescription: "Named after Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, this effect describes how people tend to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. The unresolved tension or cognitive 'need' to finish the task keeps it more accessible in memory. Once completed, the tension resolves, and the memory may fade more quickly. This explains why cliffhangers work and why nagging thoughts about undone chores persist.", requiredLevel: 3 },

     // --- LEVEL 4 ---
    { name: "Groupthink", category: "social", description: "Make irrational decisions to maintain group harmony.", example: "Compromise badly to avoid conflict (ice cream T-shirts).", id: "groupthink", longDescription: "Coined by Irving Janis, Groupthink occurs when a group prioritizes consensus and harmony over critical evaluation of alternatives. Symptoms include an illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalization, pressure on dissenters, self-censorship, and belief in the group's inherent morality. This can lead to flawed decisions as alternative viewpoints are suppressed or ignored. Famous examples often cited include the Bay of Pigs invasion planning and the Challenger space shuttle disaster.", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Curse of Knowledge", category: "learning", description: "Assume others know what we know.", example: "Teacher struggles to see novice perspective.", id: "curse-of-knowledge", longDescription: "Once we know something well, it becomes difficult to imagine what it's like *not* to know it. This cognitive bias hinders our ability to explain concepts clearly to beginners or to understand their perspective. Experts might use jargon, skip crucial steps, or underestimate the difficulty of a task for a novice. It impacts teaching, communication, product design, and collaboration, highlighting the importance of consciously adopting the learner's viewpoint.", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Reactance", category: "belief", description: "Do opposite of what we're told to assert freedom.", example: "Student refuses homework when told to do it.", id: "reactance", longDescription: "Reactance is a motivational reaction that occurs when a person feels their freedom of choice is being threatened or eliminated. This perceived threat can lead to the person adopting or strengthening a contrary view or behavior, essentially doing the opposite of what was intended, as a way to restore their sense of autonomy. This is often seen in response to persuasion attempts, rules, or regulations perceived as overly controlling.", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Belief Bias", category: "belief", description: "Judge argument strength by conclusion plausibility, not logic.", example: "Accepting weak argument for a believed conclusion.", id: "belief-bias", longDescription: "Belief Bias is our tendency to judge the logical strength of an argument based on whether we find its conclusion believable or acceptable, rather than on whether the premises actually support the conclusion according to logical rules. We are more likely to accept an invalid argument if the conclusion aligns with our beliefs, and reject a valid argument if the conclusion contradicts them. It separates the evaluation of logical structure from the evaluation of content.", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Zero-Risk Bias", category: "money", description: "Prefer eliminating small risk completely over reducing larger risk.", example: "Buying unnecessary warranty.", id: "zero-risk-bias", longDescription: "We tend to disproportionately favor options that promise to completely eliminate a specific risk, even if an alternative option achieves a greater overall reduction in risk but doesn't eliminate any single risk entirely. The certainty of eliminating *a* risk feels more appealing than merely reducing a larger, potentially more significant risk. This influences decisions in areas like insurance, product safety features, and environmental policy.", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Authority Bias", category: "politics", description: "Trust/influenced more by authority figures.", example: "'My teacher said it was okay.'", id: "authority-bias", longDescription: "This is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy and weight to the opinion of an authority figure (based on perceived status, expertise, or power) and be more influenced by that opinion, often regardless of the actual content. We learn early to obey authority (parents, teachers), which is generally adaptive. However, this bias can lead us to follow instructions or accept information uncritically, even when the authority figure is wrong or acting outside their area of expertise (e.g., celebrity endorsements).", requiredLevel: 4 },
    { name: "Bystander Effect", category: "social", description: "Less likely to help victim when others are present.", example: "Crowd doesn't call 911 during a fight.", id: "bystander-effect", longDescription: "Also known as bystander apathy, this social psychological theory states that individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when there are other people present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. This is thought to be due to diffusion of responsibility (assuming someone else will act) and social influence (interpreting inaction from others as meaning the situation isn't serious).", requiredLevel: 4 },

     // --- LEVEL 5 ---
    { name: "Moral Luck", category: "social", description: "Attribute outcomes to moral standing.", example: "'Winners were morally superior.'", id: "moral-luck", longDescription: "Moral Luck describes situations where a moral agent is assigned blame or praise for an action or its consequences, even if it's clear that the action and/or its consequences were significantly outside the agent's control. For example, two people driving equally recklessly, but only one causes an accident due to chance factors – the one who caused harm is often judged more harshly morally. It challenges the idea that morality is purely about intention and controllable actions.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "Forer Effect (Barnum Effect)", category: "belief", description: "Accept vague statements as specific personal insights.", example: "'This horoscope is so accurate!'", id: "forer-effect", longDescription: "Named after psychologist Bertram R. Forer, this effect (also called the Barnum Effect after P.T. Barnum's 'we've got something for everyone' approach) refers to our tendency to accept vague and general personality descriptions as uniquely applicable to ourselves. Horoscopes, fortune-telling, and some personality tests rely heavily on this bias, using statements that are true for most people ('You have a need for other people to like and admire you'). Our desire for self-understanding makes us prone to finding personal meaning in ambiguity.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "Third-Person Effect", category: "belief", description: "Believe media affects others more than ourselves.", example: "'You're brainwashed by the media!'", id: "third-person-effect", longDescription: "This hypothesis predicts that people tend to perceive that mass media messages (especially persuasive or negative ones like propaganda or advertising) have a greater effect on others ('third persons') than on themselves. We often believe we are more discerning and less susceptible to influence than the average person. This can lead to support for censorship ('to protect others') or underestimation of media's impact on our own attitudes and behaviors.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "Declinism", category: "belief", description: "Romanticize past, view future negatively.", example: "'Things were better in my day!'", id: "declinism", longDescription: "Declinism is the belief that a particular society, institution, or civilization is in a state of irreversible decline. It often involves romanticizing a past era ('golden age' thinking) and viewing the present and future with pessimism. This bias can be fueled by selective memory (forgetting the negatives of the past) and the Availability Heuristic (focusing on current problems). While critical assessment is important, pervasive declinism can hinder progress and foster unproductive nostalgia.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "IKEA Effect", category: "money", description: "Value things we helped create more highly.", example: "Loving the pot you painted yourself.", id: "ikea-effect", longDescription: "This cognitive bias leads people to place a disproportionately high value on products they have partially assembled or created themselves (like IKEA furniture, hence the name). The effort invested, even if frustrating, increases the sense of ownership and pride, leading to an inflated perception of the item's quality or worth. This 'effort justification' makes us cherish the fruits of our labor more.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "False Memory", category: "memory", description: "Mistake imagination/dreams for real memories.", example: "Certain a friend told a joke from a TV show.", id: "false-memory", longDescription: "A false memory is a recollection of an event, or details of an event, that did not actually occur. These can range from minor inaccuracies to detailed recollections of entire events that never happened. They can arise from suggestion, misattribution (confusing the source of information, like mistaking a dream for reality), or the constructive nature of memory itself, which rebuilds past experiences rather than replaying them perfectly.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "Clustering Illusion", category: "belief", description: "Find patterns/clusters in random data.", example: "'That cloud looks like a cat!'", id: "clustering-illusion", longDescription: "This is the tendency to erroneously perceive clusters or patterns in random sequences or spatial configurations. Our brains are wired to find patterns, sometimes imposing them even where none exist. This leads to seeing 'hot streaks' in random events (like gambling), finding shapes in clouds (pareidolia), or identifying trends in random stock market fluctuations. Recognizing randomness is surprisingly difficult for the human mind.", requiredLevel: 5 },
    { name: "Blind Spot Bias", category: "belief", description: "Fail to recognize our own biases, see them in others.", example: "'I'm not biased, but you are!'", id: "blind-spot-bias", longDescription: "This is the cognitive bias of failing to recognize one's *own* cognitive biases, while readily identifying the impact of biases on the judgments of *others*. We seem to believe we are less biased than the average person. This occurs partly because biases often operate unconsciously, and introspection isn't reliable for detecting them. It makes self-correction difficult and can exacerbate conflicts where both parties assume the other is the biased one.", requiredLevel: 5 },

    // --- LEVEL 6 ---
    { name: "Defensive Attribution", category: "belief", description: "Blame victim less if we relate to them.", example: "Texting driver yells at person who rear-ended phone-using driver.", id: "defensive-attribution", longDescription: "This hypothesis suggests we attribute more blame to a victim of an accident or crime as the severity of the outcome increases, especially if the situation seems random or uncontrollable. Paradoxically, if we perceive ourselves as similar to the victim, we might blame them *less* severely to distance ourselves from the potential threat ('That wouldn't happen to me because *I'm* more careful'). It's a way of managing fear and maintaining a belief in personal control, but can lead to victim-blaming.", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Naïve Realism", category: "belief", description: "Believe we see reality objectively; others are biased.", example: "'I see things as they are, others are dumb.'", id: "naive-realism", longDescription: "This is the human tendency to believe that we see the world around us objectively, and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, irrational, or biased. We assume our perception *is* reality. This leads to underestimating the subjectivity of our own views and overestimating the extent to which others share them (related to False Consensus). It's a significant barrier to conflict resolution and understanding diverse perspectives.", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Automation Bias", category: "learning", description: "Over-trust automated systems.", example: "Assuming auto-correct grammar is always right.", id: "automation-bias", longDescription: "This is the tendency to excessively depend on automated systems and trust their output, sometimes ignoring contradictory information or intuition. We might over-rely on GPS even if the route looks wrong, trust diagnostic software without double-checking, or accept automated suggestions uncritically. While automation is helpful, this bias can lead to errors of omission (missing system failures) or commission (following incorrect automated guidance).", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Availability Cascade", category: "belief", description: "Belief gains plausibility through public repetition.", example: "Urban legends spreading widely (razors in candy).", id: "availability-cascade", longDescription: "This is a self-reinforcing cycle where a collective belief gains increasing public acceptance through its growing repetition in public discourse. A novel idea or minor event gets picked up by the media (leveraging the Availability Heuristic), leading to public concern, which prompts more media coverage, making the idea seem even more plausible and important. This can distort risk perception and lead to policy decisions based on perceived rather than actual threats.", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Outgroup Homogeneity Bias", category: "social", description: "See out-groups as similar, in-group as diverse.", example: "'All gamers are the same.'", id: "outgroup-homogeneity-bias", longDescription: "This is the tendency to perceive members of an out-group (a group to which one does not belong) as being more similar to each other ('they are all alike') than members of one's own in-group are perceived to be ('we are diverse individuals'). This may occur because we typically have more interaction and familiarity with members of our own group, allowing us to notice individual differences more easily. It contributes to the formation and maintenance of stereotypes.", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Suggestibility", category: "memory", description: "Mistake suggested ideas for memories (esp. children).", example: "Leading question implants false memory details.", id: "suggestibility", longDescription: "Suggestibility is the quality of being inclined to accept and act on the suggestions of others. In the context of memory, it refers to how easily misinformation or leading questions can be incorporated into one's recollection of an event, potentially creating distorted or false memories. Children and individuals under stress or hypnosis are often more suggestible. It highlights the malleability of memory and the importance of careful questioning in interviews or therapy.", requiredLevel: 6 },
    { name: "Pessimism Bias", category: "belief", description: "Overestimate likelihood of negative outcomes.", example: "'Nothing will ever get better.'", id: "pessimism-bias", longDescription: "Pessimism Bias involves the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of negative events and underestimate the likelihood of positive events. Individuals with this bias may anticipate failure, focus on potential downsides, and have a generally negative outlook on the future. While mild pessimism might encourage careful planning, excessive pessimism can lead to anxiety, depression, and inaction due to anticipated negative consequences.", requiredLevel: 6 },

    { name: "Naïve Cynicism", category: "belief", description: "Believe others are more egocentric than they are.", example: "'They're only nice to get something.'", id: "naive-cynicism", longDescription: "This cognitive bias involves expecting others' motivations to be more self-centered and driven by self-interest than they actually are. We might distrust acts of kindness or cooperation, assuming an ulterior, selfish motive underlies them. While some degree of skepticism can be healthy, naïve cynicism can lead to unnecessary suspicion, damage relationships, and hinder collaborative efforts by assuming the worst about others' intentions.", requiredLevel: 7 },
    { name: "Tachypsychia", category: "memory", description: "Time perception shifts under stress/trauma.", example: "'Time slowed down during the accident.'", id: "tachypsychia", longDescription: "Tachypsychia refers to the distorted perception of time that can occur during high-stress, traumatic, or physically exertive situations. Commonly, people report events seeming to unfold in slow motion, allowing for perception of more detail. Less commonly, time might seem to speed up, or events might be perceived out of sequence. The exact neurological mechanism is debated but likely involves heightened arousal and altered processing of sensory information by the brain under duress.", requiredLevel: 7 },
    { name: "Law of Triviality", category: "politics", description: "Give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.", example: "City council debates bike sheds, ignores homelessness.", id: "law-of-triviality", longDescription: "Coined by C. Northcote Parkinson, this principle (also known as 'bike-shedding') argues that groups tend to spend excessive time discussing trivial issues they all understand, while avoiding complex, important issues that are harder to grasp. Debating a simple item like a bike shed color allows everyone to participate and voice opinions, whereas tackling a nuclear power plant design (Parkinson's original example) requires expertise few possess. This can lead to neglect of critical matters.", requiredLevel: 7 },
    { name: "Ben Franklin Effect", category: "social", description: "More likely to do a favor for someone we already helped.", example: "Loaned a pen, more likely to loan $5.", id: "ben-franklin-effect", longDescription: "This psychological phenomenon suggests that we grow to like people for whom we do favors. When we perform a kindness for someone, our brain resolves the cognitive dissonance ('Why did I help this person?') by concluding we must like them. This is the reverse of the intuitive idea that we do favors for people we already like. Franklin himself noted observing this after asking a rival legislator to borrow a rare book.", requiredLevel: 7 },
    { name: "Cryptomnesia", category: "memory", description: "Mistake real memories for imagination.", example: "Thinking a real past event was just a dream.", id: "cryptomnesia", longDescription: "Cryptomnesia occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original. This is often described as 'unintentional plagiarism' in creative fields, where an artist might reproduce a work they encountered previously but genuinely believe they created it themselves. It can also involve mistaking a real past event for a dream or imagined scenario. It highlights failures in source monitoring in memory.", requiredLevel: 7 },
    { name: "Optimism Bias", category: "belief", description: "Overestimate likelihood of positive outcomes.", example: "'It's going to turn out great!'", id: "optimism-bias", longDescription: "Also known as unrealistic optimism or the 'illusion of invulnerability,' this cognitive bias causes a person to believe that they are less likely to experience a negative event (like illness or accidents) and more likely to experience positive events (like success or longevity) compared to others. While promoting motivation and well-being, excessive optimism can lead to risky behaviors and inadequate preparation for potential setbacks.", requiredLevel: 7 },
